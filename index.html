    <div class="info-slide"><div class="content-wrap"><img src="img/slide-1.jpg" class="slide-pics"><p class="slide-text">Wakeboards as we know them started with San Diego surfer Tony Finn. Finn created the Skurfer, a cross between a water ski and a surfboard, in 1985 and marketed it heavily.
    However, for many years, the Skurfer was considered a toy by the public, who favored the new kneeboard. Pictured here is Finn riding his Skurfer in an ad for the board.</p></div></div>
    
    <div class="info-slide"><div class="content-wrap"><img src="img/slide-2.jpg" class="slide-pics"><p class="slide-text">Herb O'Brien, owner of H.O. Sports, took an interest in wakeboarding and created the Hyperlite, the first compression-molded wakeboard, in 1991.
    Its natural buoyancy allowed for easy deep-water starts, making wakeboarding accessible for many more people. Pictured here is Eric Perez, winner of the first “Skurfer Skiboard World Championships” held in 1990, riding the new board.</p></div></div>
    
     <div class="info-slide"><div class="content-wrap"><img src="img/slide-3.jpg" class="slide-pics"><p class="slide-text">In 1999, the World Wakeboard Council (WWC) was formed as a part of the International Waterski Federation (IWSF). The purpose was to bring together wakeboarders from around the world.
     the first IWSF Wakeboard World Championships were held in 2000 in Montpellier, France.</p></div></div>
     
    <div class="info-slide"><div class="content-wrap"><img src="img/slide-5.jpg" class="slide-pics"><p class="slide-text">In 2009, the IWSF changed its name to the International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation (IWWF).
    The IWWF holds championships for both sports in a variety of categories, including cable wakeboarding and barefoot waterskiing.</p></div></div>
    
    <div class="info-slide"><div class="content-wrap"><img src="img/slide-6.jpg" class="slide-pics"><p class="slide-text">Today, almost 4 million people wakeboard.
    It is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.</p></div></div>
