        <div class="slide" id="slide-one"><p>The Skurfer: Wakeboards as we know them started with San Diego surfer Tony Finn.
        Finn created the Skurfer, a cross between a water ski and a surfboard, in 1985 and marketed it heavily.
        However, for many years, the Skurfer was considered a toy by the public, who favored the new kneeboard.
        Pictured here is a wakeboarder riding a Liquid Force board, the company Finn would help found in 1995.</p></div>
    
        <div class="slide" id="slide-two"><p>The Hyperlite: Herb O'Brien, owner of H.O. Sports, took an interest in wakeboarding
        and created the Hyperlite, the first <a href=# class="q-site-three">compression-molded</a> wakeboard, in 1991.
        Its natural buoyancy allowed for easy deep-water starts, making wakeboarding accessible for many more people.
        The Hyperlite is still considered a premiere board in the wakeboarding world.</p></div>
    
         <div class="slide" id="slide-three"><p>The WWC: In 1999, the World Wakeboard Council (WWC) was formed as a part of the International
         Waterski Federation (IWSF). The purpose was to bring together wakeboarders from around the world.
         The first IWSF Wakeboard World Championships were held in 2000 in Montpellier, France.</p></div>
     
        <div class="slide" id="slide-four"><p>The IWWF: In 2009, the IWSF changed its name to the International
        Waterski & Wakeboard Federation <a href=# class="q-site">(IWWF)</a>.
        The IWWF holds championships for both sports in a variety of categories, including <a href=# class="q-site-two">cable wakeboarding</a>
        and barefoot waterskiing.</p></div>
    
        <div class="slide" id="slide-five"><p>The Future: Today, almost 4 million people wakeboard.
        It is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.</p>
